			<h2 id="Resources"> <strong> Resources </strong> </h2>
				<p> Resources are the basis of Minecraft. Resources are collected from blocks that represent different elements.
				When you first spawn into the game, you will want to collect wood immediately. This may seem a little obvious,
				but wood is collected from trees by pushing and holding the mining key on a wood block until it is broken. 
				Once the wooden block is broken, it will drop a resource for you to collect representing wood. This can be
				done with any block in the game with the exception of bedrock, which is unbreakable and essentially the bottom of
				the map for digging.

			<h2 id="Crafting"> <strong> Crafting </strong> </h2>
				<p> Once you have collected some resources, you can begin crafting various items. The first item you will want to
				craft is wooden planks from the wood you have gathered. You accomplish this by going into the crafting menu by pressing
				the X button and selecting wooden planks. Once you have enough wooden planks crafted, you can then craft a crafting table. 
				A crafting table allows you to craft way more items than what you can craft from your base inventory. The first 
				items you will want to make are tools, which are discussed in the next section. The second thing you should craft after
				building a house is a furnace. A furnace is used to cook or heat different materials. You need two things to make a
				furnace work. The first is fuel. Fuel can either be in the form of raw wood or coal. The second thing you need is 
				something to heat or cook. The most common items to put in the furnace are raw meats for food. Lastly, once your 
				building and furnace are up, you should build a bed. A bed is made from three pieces of wool and three wood planks.
				You can get wool from shearing or killing sheep. Shearing allows the sheep to live and regrow its wool.

			<h2 id="Tools"> <strong> Tools </strong></h2>
				<p> Tools are an essential part of gathering materials and defending yourself. Gathering tools reduce the time
				it takes to break a block. However, you must know the right tools for the job. The first tool to craft is the
				pickaxe. The pickaxe is your go to tool for gathering different types of stone blocks. Some examples are cobblestone,
				iron, coal, and gold. The pickaxe is only good for collecting stone. For example, it will have no benefit in collecting
				wood. To collect wood you need an axe. An axe is effective in collecting all types of wood, including any wooden planks
				you put down. The tool for collecting dirt is the shovel. The shovel is the tool you need to quickly collect sand, dirt,
				and gravel. For the most part, the shovel gets these annoying blocks out of your way, but sand is useful for building
				decorative items such as glass. Gathering tools aren't the only tools that you can make. There are many other tools that
				you can find in the crafting section. One is the hoe, which is used to till ground for planting plants such as wheat and
				trees. The other tools are for your defense. You can craft swords, bows, and armor from materials you gather. 
				Swords and bows damage monsters and armor reduces the damage you take from monsters. One of the most useful tools in
				the game are torches, which create light for you to see in dark places. Monsters cannot spawn within 16 blocks of torches.

			<h2 id= "BuildingStructures"> <strong> Building Structures </strong> </h2>
				<p> Soon after you begin to build tools and gather resources, night falls and monsters begin to spawn around you.
				it is vital that you learn to build a structure to protect you. You can lay down blocks by selecting a block, such as 
				a wooden plank, in your inventory and pulling the left trigger. This lays down one block. You can continue to lay blocks
				on top of one another to build height or adjacent to one another to build width. I suggest making an empty rectangular
				structure four blocks high, ten blocks wide and ten blocks deep. Also build a roof for your structure so spiders can't
				enter. This will leave your structure dark, but it will be safe for the night until most of the monsters disappear or
				die when daylight hits. However, if you have built torches from coal or by burning wood in the furnace to make charcoal,
				you can light up your house. There are a couple things to consider when building a structure. Keep in mind where you might
				want a door. This will make it far easier to get in and out of your house without having to break any blocks. Once you
				build your door, you can make it easier to exit by placing a wooden or stone pressure plate on the inside next to the doorway
				and it will open automatically when you step on it. <em> Warning: you do not want to do this on the outside of the door,
				as it will let monsters who step on it right into your house.</em> For the outside of the door you could place a button
				to press that will open the door when you press it with the left trigger. This is optional as sometimes it makes it more
				difficult to enter your building. One last note on doors is that zombies can break down wooden doors, but not iron doors.
				Iron doors require a power source such as a button or a pressure plate to open. This will keep you safe for now. I will
				add decorations to this section later.

			<h2 id = "GatheringFood" > <strong> Gathering Food </strong> </h2>
				<p> In Minecraft you have a food bar that slowly depletes over time. When your food bar is full, your health will slowly
				regenerate over time if you are damaged. Therefore, food is very important. If you have time before your first nightfall,
				you can collect food from killing cows, chickens, or pigs. You can then cook the meat in the furnace to provide yourself
				sustenance. You should always keep food on you when exploring, as you can be damaged by monsters or falling. 
				</p>

			<h2 id = "Monsters"> <strong> Monsters </strong> </h2>
				<p> Monsters are what make Minecraft a fun and challenging game. Monsters come out at night. There are a variety of 
				monsters that have different abilities and drop different items, some of which are useful and others, not so much.
				</p>

				<h3> Creepers </h3>
				<p> Creepers are particularly nasty monsters. When they get close to you they explode, destroying most of what's around
				them, including you. When killed, creepers drop gunpowder, which can be used to create TNT. The best way to kill a creeper
				is from a distance so they don't blow up on you. The best way to accomplish this is using a bow. It should be noted that
				creepers can survive daylight, but aren't as aggressive during the day. They will still attack you if you get too close,
				so be careful.

				<h3> Zombies </h3>
				<p> Zombies are probably the most common monsters that spawn at night. The sounds they make are creepy for a simplistic
				game like Minecraft. Zombies can only attack you in melee range and are relatively easy to take down with a sword.
				They drop rotten flesh which is completely useless unless you are desperate for food and food poisoning. One
				thing you have to look out for with zombies is that they can break down wooden doors which can cause you a whole myriad
				of problems at night. When daylight hits, zombies will catch on fire in the sunlight, but be careful, if they are in
				water or the shade, they can survive and still attack you during the day.

				<h3> Skeletons </h3>
				<p> Skeletons are monsters that attack you with a bow. They are hard to kill in open areas because of their accuracy.
				However, you can try zig zagging which works relatively well if you have just a sword. Your other option is to take them
				out via an arrow fight. Once killed, they drop bones which can be used to tame wolves and arrows which you can use for
				bow ammunition.

				<h3> Spiders </h3>
				<p> Spiders are around during the day and night. They will not attack you during the day unless you attack them; however,
				at night, they become aggressive and attack on sight. Spiders have the ability to climb almost any material. This
				is why it is so vital to put a roof on your structures. Spiders are pretty easy to kill with a sword, but can be pretty
				annoying because they jump at your from a range. When you kill them, they drop string. This can be used to make a bow,
				or some wool, which is needed to make a bed.

				<h3> Enderman </h3>
				<p> Endermen are interesting monsters. They are tall black humanoid with purple eyes.
				They don't like to be looked at. They will not attack you unless you look at them.
				They also collect random blocks. They are difficult to kill because they have the ability to teleport. If you hit one
				with your sword, he will teleport to another location and then come back to attack you again. Attention to detail is
				the key to killing these monsters and you may get a nice reward for doing so. If the enderman is carrying a valuable
				block, then you can pick that up once he's dead. They also drop eyes of ender, which lead the way to "The End" when used.
				The End is the place where you can kill a large enderdragon for large amounts of experience. Unfortunately, this feature
				is not yet implemented in the xbox 360 version.
				</p>
				<p> These are all of the monsters that you are likely to encounter as a beginner. There are a couple more out there
				in the world, but I won't ruin all of the fun for you.

				<h2 id="Animals"> <strong> Animals </strong> </h2>
				<p> Animals are an important part of collecting food and other materials. Some animals can even protect you.
				The cow, when killed, they drop leather and raw steak. The leather can be used to make armor and the steak can be cooked
				in the furnace and eaten as food. The pig is a simple animal. When killed, it drops raw pork chops which can be cooked
				to make cooked pork chops. The chicken is another animal that can be killed for food. It drops raw chicken meat which 
				can also be cooked and it makes cooked chicken meat. Those are all of the animals that can be killed for meat. The sheep
				is a different type of animal. When you kill it, it drops wool. You can also build shears and shear it for wool as well.
				Shearing sheep drops more wool than killing sheep so it is the better option if you have the materials to make shears.
				Wool is used to make beds and can also be dyed in a variety of ways to make decorative items. For example, you can
				use a rose to make dye, apply it to wool to make red wool, and then make red carpet with it. There are two other 
				animals in the game that you can tame and they will protect you. You can have them follow you or have them stay in place, while you are off
				doing some task. The first animal is the wolf. You have to tame it with
				a bone. You can get bones from killing skeletons. Once you have a bone, go up to a wild wolf and press the left trigger.
				It may take a couple tries because taming is based on statistics. The wolf will protect you from all monsters with the
				exception of creepers. This is where the ocelot comes in. The ocelot is elusive and has to be snuck up on. Clicking the
				left stick will allow you to crouch which makes less noise. If you are able to get close enough, the ocelot can be
				tamed with fish. The ocelot will protect you from the creepers. It protects from intimidation. It simply keeps creepers
				away from you.
				</p>
			
			
				<!--insert love picture here got it-->
				<img src="http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/578194_101507093366837_517669147_n.jpg" alt="Pig in Love">
				<p>Animals can be lured wherever you want in the game given you have the correct materials. Sheep, cows, and pigs can
				be lured by holding wheat in your hand. Chickens can be lured with wheat seeds. The wolf can be lured with raw meat
				except fish, and the ocelot can be lured with raw fish. A useful technique when luring animals is creating a farm.
				You can do this in a variety of ways. In my game, I created a barn with different enclosed fences with gates to get in
				and out of. I then lured two of each type of animal into the enclosures and shut the gate. Once you have two of one
				animal they can be bred to make another of the same type of animal. They animal slowly grows up into an adult. To put
				two animals into love mode, use the same material you used to lure it and press the left trigger. Once both animals
				are in love mode, they will breed. Now you have a way to never run out of any materials from animals.

				<h2 id="NaturalStructures"> <strong> Natural Structures </strong> </h2>
				<p> Sometimes when you are wandering the wilds, you will encounter a prebuilt structure that was rendered when you
				first created the world. The most common natural structures are villages. Villages contain villagers that you can
				trade items with. The villagers all have houses that they live in and that you can utilize as your own as well. All
				you have to do is build a bed. Another above ground structure you might stumble across is a temple. These are found
				in the desert and are relatively worthless. Every once and a while you will run into a monster, usually a skeleton
				that has escaped the daylight and taken refuge inside. Otherwise, there isn't anything of worth inside these temples.
				Now we have to go underground to find the other two structures. The first are old miningc shafts. These are nice
				to find, because it means that you don't have to dig. They can also lead you to useful places that contain valuable
				materials such as diamond or obsidian. The second underground structure and the last natural structure in the game
				is the fortress. This might sound like a nice place to find, but it really isn't. This is a fortress for monsters
				contains the end portal inside which must be activated with nine eyes of ender. Unfortunately for us Xbox users, the
				end portal has yet to be implemented into the game. It will come in a later update.
