			<p>This website is set up as a tutorial for those of you who are new to Minecraft, for either the PC or the Xbox 360.
			It will include a variety of subjects for new players to be aware of and how to construct a simple shelter for your
			first night of survival.

		<h2> <strong> Resources </strong> </h2>
			<p> Resources are the basis of Minecraft. Resources are collected from blocks that represent different elements.
			When you first spawn into the game, you will want to collect wood immediately. This may seem a little obvious,
			but wood is collected from trees by pushing and holding the mining key on a wood block until it is broken. 
			Once the wooden block is broken, it will drop a resource for you to collect representing wood. This can be
			done with any block in the game with the exception of bedrock, which is unbreakable and essentially the bottom of
			the map for digging.
			</p>

		<h2> <strong> Crafting </strong> </h2>
			<p> Once you have collected some resources, you can begin crafting various items. The first item you will want to
			craft is wooden planks from the wood you have gathered. You accomplish this by going into the crafting menu by pressing
			the X button and selecting wooden planks. Once you have enough wooden planks crafted, you can then craft a crafting table. 
			A crafting table allows you to craft way more items than what you can craft from your base inventory. The first 
			items you will want to make are tools, which are discussed in the next section. The second thing you should craft after
			building a house is a furnace. A furnace is used to cook or heat different materials. You need two things to make a
			furnace work. The first is fuel. Fuel can either be in the form of raw wood or coal. The second thing you need is 
			something to heat or cook. The most common items to put in the furnace are raw meats for food. Lastly, once your 
			building and furnace are up, you should build a bed. A bed is made from three pieces of wool and three wood planks.
			You can get wool from shearing or killing sheep. Shearing allows the sheep to live and regrow its wool.

		<h2> <strong> Tools </strong></h2>
			<p> Tools are an essential part of gathering materials and defending yourself. Gathering tools reduce the time
			it takes to break a block. However, you must know the right tools for the job. The first tool to craft is the
			pickaxe. The pickaxe is your go to tool for gathering different types of stone blocks. Some examples are cobblestone,
			iron, coal, and gold. The pickaxe is only good for collecting stone. For example, it will have no benefit in collecting
			wood. To collect wood you need an axe. An axe is effective in collecting all types of wood, including any wooden planks
			you put down. The tool for collecting dirt is the shovel. The shovel is the tool you need to quickly collect sand, dirt,
			and gravel. For the most part, the shovel gets these annoying blocks out of your way, but sand is useful for building
			decorative items such as glass. Gathering tools aren't the only tools that you can make. There are many other tools that
			you can find in the crafting section. One is the hoe, which is used to till ground for planting plants such as wheat and
			trees. The other tools are for your defense. You can craft swords, bows, and armor from materials you gather. 
			Swords and bows damage monsters and armor reduces the damage you take from monsters. One of the most useful tools in
			the game are torches, which create light for you to see in dark places. Monsters cannot spawn within 16 blocks of torches.
			</p>

		<h2> <strong> Building Structures </strong> </h2>
			<p> Soon after you begin to build tools and gather resources, night falls and monsters begin to spawn around you.
			it is vital that you learn to build a structure to protect you. You can lay down blocks by selecting a block, such as 
			a wooden plank, in your inventory and pulling the left trigger. This lays down one block. You can continue to lay blocks
			on top of one another to build height or adjacent to one another to build width. I suggest making an empty rectangular
			structure four blocks high, ten blocks wide and ten blocks deep. Also build a roof for your structure so spiders can't
			enter. This will leave your structure dark, but it will be safe for the night until most of the monsters disappear or
			die when daylight hits. However, if you have built torches from coal or by burning wood in the furnace to make charcoal,
			you can light up your house. There are a couple things to consider when building a structure. Keep in mind where you might
			want a door. This will make it far easier to get in and out of your house without having to break any blocks. Once you
			build your door, you can make it easier to exit by placing a wooden or stone pressure plate on the inside next to the doorway
			and it will open automatically when you step on it. <em> Warning: you do not want to do this on the outside of the door,
			as it will let monsters who step on it right into your house.</em> For the outside of the door you could place a button
			to press that will open the door when you press it with the left trigger. This is optional as sometimes it makes it more
			difficult to enter your building. One last note on doors is that zombies can break down wooden doors, but not iron doors.
			Iron doors require a power source such as a button or a pressure plate to open. This will keep you safe for now. I will
			add decorations to this section later.
			</p>

		<h2> <strong> Gathering Food </strong> </h2>
			<p> In Minecraft you have a food bar that slowly depletes over time. When your food bar is full, your health will slowly
			regenerate over time if you are damaged. Therefore, food is very important. If you have time before your first nightfall,
			you can collect food from killing cows, chickens, or pigs. You can then cook the meat in the furnace to provide yourself
			sustenance. You should always keep food on you when exploring, as you can be damaged by monsters or falling. 
			</p>

		<h2> <strong> Monsters </strong> </h2>
			<p> Monsters are what make Minecraft a fun and challenging game. Monsters come out at night. There are a variety of 
			monsters that have different abilities and drop different items, some of which are useful and others, not so much.
			</p>
			<h3> Creepers </h3>
			<p> Creepers are particularly nasty monsters. When they get close to you they explode, destroying most of what's around
			them, including you. When killed, creepers drop gunpowder, which can be used to create TNT. The best way to kill a creeper
			is from a distance so they don't blow up on you. The best way to accomplish this is using a bow. It should be noted that
			creepers can survive daylight, but aren't as aggressive during the day. They will still attack you if you get too close,
			so be careful.
			</p>
			
			<h3> Zombies </h3>
			<p> Zombies are probably the most common monsters that spawn at night. The sounds they make are creepy for a simplistic
			game like Minecraft. Zombies can only attack you in melee range and are relatively easy to take down with a sword.
			They drop rotten flesh which is completely useless unless you are desperate for food and food poisoning. One
			thing you have to look out for with zombies is that they can break down wooden doors which can cause you a whole myriad
			of problems at night. When daylight hits, zombies will catch on fire in the sunlight, but be careful, if they are in
			water or the shade, they can survive and still attack you during the day.
			</p>
			
			<h3> Skeletons </h3>
			<p> Skeletons are monsters that attack you with a bow. They are hard to kill in open areas because of their accuracy.
			However, you can try zig zagging which works relatively well if you have just a sword. Your other option is to take them
			out via an arrow fight. Once killed, they drop bones which can be used to tame wolves and arrows which you can use for
			bow ammunition.
			</p>
			
			<h3> Spiders </h3>
			<p> Spiders are around during the day and night. They will not attack you during the day unless you attack them; however,
			at night, they become aggressive and attack on sight. Spiders have the ability to climb almost any material. This
			is why it is so vital to put a roof on your structures. Spiders are pretty easy to kill with a sword, but can be pretty
			annoying because they jump at your from a range. When you kill them, they drop string. This can be used to make a bow,
			or some wool, which is needed to make a bed.
			</p>
			
			<h3> Enderman </h3>
			<p> Endermen are interesting monsters. They are tall black humanoid with purple eyes.
			 They don't like to be looked at. They will not attack you unless you look at them.
			They also collect random blocks. They are difficult to kill because they have the ability to teleport. If you hit one
			with your sword, he will teleport to another location and then come back to attack you again. Attention to detail is
			the key to killing these monsters and you may get a nice reward for doing so. If the enderman is carrying a valuable
			block, then you can pick that up once he's dead. They also drop eyes of ender, which lead the way to "The End" when used.
			The End is the place where you can kill a large enderdragon for large amounts of experience. Unfortunately, this feature
			is not yet implemented in the xbox 360 version.
			</p>
			<p> These are all of the monsters that you are likely to encounter as a beginner. There are a couple more out there
			in the world, but I won't ruin all of the fun for you.
