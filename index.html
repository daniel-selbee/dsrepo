			<p>This website is set up as a tutorial for those of you who are new to Minecraft, for either the PC or the Xbox 360.
			It will include a variety of subjects for new players to be aware of and how to construct a simple shelter for your
			first night of survival.

		<h2> <strong> Resources </strong> </h2>
			<p> Resources are the basis of Minecraft. Resources are collected from blocks that represent different elements.
			When you first spawn into the game, you will want to collect wood immediately. This may seem a little obvious,
			but wood is collected from trees by pushing and holding the mining key on a wood block until it is broken. 
			Once the wooden block is broken, it will drop a resource for you to collect representing wood. This can be
			done with any block in the game with the exception of bedrock, which is unbreakable and essentially the bottom of
			the map for digging.
			</p>

		<h2> <strong> Crafting </h2>
			<p> Once you have collected some resources, you can begin crafting various items. The first item you will want to
			craft is wooden planks from the wood you have gathered. You accomplish this by going into the crafting menu
			(x)and selecting wooden planks. Once you have enough wooden planks crafted, you can then craft a crafting table. 
			A crafting table allows you to craft way more items than what you can craft from your base inventory. The first 
			items you will want to make are tools, which are discussed in the next section.
