			<p>This website is set up as a tutorial for those of you who are new to Minecraft, for either the PC or the Xbox 360.
			It will include a variety of subjects for new players to be aware of and how to construct a simple shelter for your
			first night of survival.

		<h2> <strong> Resources </strong> </h2>
			<p> Resources are the basis of Minecraft. Resources are collected from blocks that represent different elements.
			When you first spawn into the game, you will want to collect wood immediately. This may seem a little obvious,
			but wood is collected from trees by pushing and holding the mining key on a wood block until it is broken. 
			Once the wooden block is broken, it will drop a resource for you to collect representing wood. This can be
			done with any block in the game with the exception of bedrock, which is unbreakable and essentially the bottom of
			the map for digging.
			</p>

		<h2> <strong> Crafting </h2>
			<p> Once you have collected some resources, you can begin crafting various items. The first item you will want to
			craft is wooden planks from the wood you have gathered. You accomplish this by going into the crafting menu by pressing
			the X button and selecting wooden planks. Once you have enough wooden planks crafted, you can then craft a crafting table. 
			A crafting table allows you to craft way more items than what you can craft from your base inventory. The first 
			items you will want to make are tools, which are discussed in the next section.
			</p>

		<h2> <strong> Tools </h2>
			<p> Tools are an essential part of gathering materials and defending yourself. Gathering tools reduce the time
			it takes to break a block. However, you must know the right tools for the job. The first tool to craft is the
			pickaxe. The pickaxe is your go to tool for gathering different types of stone blocks. Some examples are cobblestone,
			iron, coal, and gold. The pickaxe is only good for collecting stone. For example, it will have no benefit in collecting
			wood. To collect wood you need an axe. An axe is effective in collecting all types of wood, including any wooden planks
			you put down. The tool for collecting dirt is the shovel. The shovel is the tool you need to quickly collect sand, dirt,
			and gravel. For the most part, the shovel gets these annoying blocks out of your way, but sand is useful for building
			decorative items such as glass. Gathering tools aren't the only tools that you can make. There are many other tools that
			you can find in the crafting section. One is the hoe, which is used to till ground for planting plants such as wheat and
			trees. The other tools are for your defense. You can craft swords, bows, and armor from materials you gather. 
			Swords and bows damage monsters and armor reduces the damage you take from monsters. One of the most useful tools in
			the game are torches, which create light for you to see in dark places. Monsters cannot spawn within 16 blocks of torches.

		<h2> <strong> Building Structures </strong> </h2>
			<p> Soon after you begin to build tools and gather resources, night falls and monsters begin to spawn around you.
			it is vital that you learn to build a structure to protect you. You can lay down blocks by selecting a block, such as 
			a wooden plank, in your inventory and pulling the left trigger. This lays down one block. You can continue to lay blocks
			on top of one another to build height or adjacent to one another to build width. I suggest making an empty rectangular
			structure four blocks high, ten blocks wide and ten blocks deep. Also build a roof for your structure so spiders can't
			enter. This will leave your structure dark, but it will be safe for the night until most of the monsters disappear or
			die when daylight hits. However, if you have built torches from coal or by burning wood in the furnace to make charcoal,
			you can light up your house. There are a couple things to consider when building a structure. Keep in mind where you might
			want a door. This will make it far easier to get in and out of your house without having to break any blocks. Once you
			build your door, you can make it easier to exit by placing a wooden or stone pressure plate on the inside next to the doorway
			and it will open automatically when you step on it. <em> Warning: you do not want to do this on the outside of the door,
			as it will let monsters who step on it right into your house.</em> For the outside of the door you could place a button
			to press that will open the door when you press it with the left trigger. This is optional as sometimes it makes it more
			difficult to enter your building. One last note on doors is that zombies can break down wooden doors, but not iron doors.
			Iron doors require a power source such as a button or a pressure plate to open. This will keep you safe for now. I will
			add decorations to this section later.
